Primary repo

My first repository contains my first solo project. 
It's a Virtual Craps Game. 
Of course, it's nothing like an actual game, with a layout, dice, great dealers, other players and real chips.
However, it gives pretty good guidence and accurate virtual payouts for the projected flow of the game.
Just enter your own commands through the user-friendly interface and see how much you can learn about the game!
Good luck!)
